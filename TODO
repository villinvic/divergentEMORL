TODO
    how to plot ?
    add margin to motivate higher entropy
    use k-nearest ?
    try with small behavior embedding

    behavior kernel with top k individuals
    bigger pop size
    shorter training session

    change pop only if diversity not decreased ?
    verify set and get arenagenes -> ok ?
    reward shaping entropy

OBS
    RS diversity not conserved -> no interersting diversity
    Diversity in population struggles to increase after early iterations
        -> need to select individuals only if it improves the diversity
