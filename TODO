TODO
    Replace individal at end of RL each time and update behavior kernel for better divergence


OBS
    Optimizing over perf and diversity is weird with MOO
    => individual scores regarding diversity depends on the current population
        => really diverse and bad player can always be selected
        ? maybe select individuals that are at least better than the worst current individual.

   We can experiment on Multi-agent !
   => alter the framework to train multiple offsprings in parallel (use elo ? no)
   => experiment on Nojima's idea
