TODO
    how to plot ?
    add margin to motivate higher entropy
    use k-nearest


OBS
    Optimizing over perf and diversity is weird with MOO
    => individual scores regarding diversity depends on the current population
        => really diverse and bad player can always be selected
        ? maybe select individuals that are at least better than the worst current individual.

    How to evaluate novelty each generation for selection ?
    => current approach : compute average behavior difference over pop and offspring
        => problem : at iteration i, individual A has a high novelty score.
                     next iteration i+1, individual B and C get generated (with A as the only parent).
                     despite the help of DvD, A, B and C has similar behaviors (but still relatively novel to the existing other behaviors in the population)
                     => average novelty score for A, B and C gets lower
                        => A, B and C do not get selected...
        => solution : compute two novelty scores : one averaged over current pop, and one over the offspring, then sum. ???
        => solution 2 : append an individual once at the time !

   We can experiment on Multi-agent !
   => alter the framework to train multiple offsprings in parallel (use elo ? no)
   => experiment on Nojima's idea
